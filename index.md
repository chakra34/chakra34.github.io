Hi!

I am Aritra Chakraborty, presently a postdoc in the [Thermal and Structural Materials Group](https://www.anl.gov/amd/thermal-and-structural-materials) in the Applied Materials Division in Argonne National Laboratory. My research focuses on developing continuum and mesoscale material models for high temperature applications, as well as statistical models and uncertainty quantification.
I defended my PhD in April 2019 from the [Computational Materials Mechanics](https://compmatermech.wordpress.com/) group in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science in Michigan State University, supervised by Dr. Philip Eisenlohr. During my PhD I focussed in developing multiphysics models in crystal plasticity framework using an efficient fourier based boundary value solver [DAMASK](https://damask.mpie.de/). The goal was to study chemo-thermo-mechanics associated with thermal stress driven diffusion in Sn thin films.
